When a new user joins the server, NightFury will welcome them.

You can make the welcome message more specific by including several flags in the message:

`{@user}` - Mentions the person who joined<br>
`{choose:}` - Chooses one of the things separated by the pipes (IE: |).

For example,
```**Hello {@user}!** Welcome to the server! We hope you enjoy your stay! {choose: :wink:|:smile:|:ok_hand:}```
