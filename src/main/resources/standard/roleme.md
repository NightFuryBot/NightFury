RoleMe roles are self-give/remove roles for normal members of a server.<br>
Simply using `|RoleMe [Role]` will give the user the `[Role]` requested or remove it if they already possess the `[Role]`, so long as it is a registered RoleMe role.

RoleMe roles must be registered by an Administrator using the `Add` sub-command.<br>
Conversely, registered RoleMe roles can be unregistered by an Administrator using the `Remove` sub-command.<br>
For those looking to limit the number of RoleMe roles a user can have, the `Limit` sub-command provides a means of doing this.
